hypermail 2.5

- CSS and hypermail

The messages generated by hypermail no longer contain CSS rules.
You now have the possibility to associate the indexes and messages
with a CSS file to customize their presentation.

You have three configuration options that let you define your own
CSS files:

- icss_url : URL of a css file you would like to use only with indexes
- mcss_url : URL of a css file you would like to use only with messages
- default_css_url : URL of a default CSS file that will be used if
             either icss_url or mcss_url are not declared. 

If default_css_url is not defined and is needed, hypermail will use
by default the name hypermail.css and will generate this file by
itself, unless it already exists in the archive directory.

- HTML5

Both the markup generated by hypermail and its documentation have
been updated to HTML5.
