Hypermail 2.5.0

If you are migrating to 2.5.0 from 2.4.0, please consult the UPGRADE
file.

*** NEW FEATURES

- HTML5

Both the markup generated by hypermail and its documentation have
been updated to HTML5.

- WAI enhancements / deprecation of text-only browser support

The generated markup was reviewed and improved for better screen
reader user experience as well as for the overall accessiblity of
hypermail. Due to the need to use HTML5 and CSS to achieve this goal,
we unfortunately had to stop generating markup that could be readable
and look good in text-only browsers, such as lynx and w3m.

- CSS and hypermail

The CSS rules that used to be inside messages generated by hypermail
have been moved to external files.

You now have the possibility to associate the indexes and messages
with a CSS file to customize their presentation.

You have three configuration options that let you define your own
CSS files:

- "icss_url" : URL of a css file you would like to use only with indexes
- "mcss_url" : URL of a css file you would like to use only with messages
- "default_css_url" : URL of a default CSS file that will be used if
             either gicss_url or mcss_url are not declared. 

If "default_css_url" is not defined and is needed, hypermail will use
the name hypermail.css and will generate this file by itself with some
pre-defined rules, unless this file already exists in the archive
directory.

Hypermail's default css file is also available under
docs/hypermail.css and will be installed with the other documentation
files.

- Navigation bar for messages

Previoulsy hypermail used the same navigation bar for both indexes and
messages.  The new configuration option "mhtmlnavbar2upfile" let's you
include in hypermail generated messages more specific HTML formatting
statement giving links to the hierarchy of your archive. By default,
this option uses the value of "ihtmlnavbar2upfile".

- Switch to PCRE2

Up to now hypermail had been using PCRE behind the scenes of its
message filtering options (docs/hmrc.html#filters). PCRE being now
at end of life, and is no longer being actively maintained, we have now
updated hypermail to support its successor, PCRE2. If you were using any
of Hypermail's filtering options, we advise you to check out PCRE2's
doc to see if there have been any changes there that may impact you:

  https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2pattern.html

As before, we're shipping the latest source of PCRE2 with hypermail.
However if your system has PCRE2 installed, hypermail will use that
one when being compiled. At this point of time we're not sure if
shipping this library source is a practice that will be continued in
the future.

- Other configuration option changes

Two new configuration options, "archive_date" and "hypermail_colophon",
allow you choose whether you want to display a line that says when the
archive was generated (only in the indexes) as well as a a line that
states that the archive was generated with hypermail and the
generation date (both in messages and indexes). Both these options may
be considered mutually exclusive as they both display the archive
generation date. You can disable both of them.

- Other code improvements

Read the Changelog for more details.

*** DEPRECATED FEATURES

The configuration variable "indextable", which let hypermail
generate message indexes using tables has been deprecated in favor of
using HTML and CSS. This option has been disabled.  The pertaining
code will be removed from the code base in a future release.

*** HYPERMAIL FEATURES THAT NEED MORE LOVE in 2.5

This is a list of features that have only been partially updated in
this version.  We are unsure if people are using them and if they
should be preserved or deprecated. If you're using any of these
features, please check that this new version of hypermail is still
working on your archive as expected.  If that's not the case, please
stick to the 2.4 version for the moment.  Feedback or code patches
(better) are welcome.

- compilation: windows LCC support (not updated, seems very old)
- showhtml option: only bare minimum of markup update done. CSS
  and generated markup could be improved.
- linkquotes: this piece of code seems to have stopped working
  at least since 2.4.0. It risks being deprecated in the next
  version of hypermail unless someone updates it.
- inline html: no specific updates done
- yearly and monthly summaries. This features seem to not have been
  updated since long time ago and missing some links letting navigate
  back from a message to the summariess to make them more useful.
  Note that you could add those links with the navbar options.
- translation of messages: some languagess are behind since years/
