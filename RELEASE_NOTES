Hypermail 2.5.0

*** NEW FEATURES

- HTML5

Both the markup generated by hypermail and its documentation have
been updated to HTML5.

- WAI enhancements / deprecation of text-only browser support

The generated markup was reviewed for better WAI compatibility. Due to
the need to use HTML5 and CSS to achieve this goal, we unfortunately
had to stop generating markup that could be readable and look good in
text-only browsers, such as lynx and w3m.

- CSS and hypermail

The CSS rules that used to be inside messages generated by hypermail
have been moved to external files.

You now have the possibility to associate the indexes and messages
with a CSS file to customize their presentation.

You have three configuration options that let you define your own
CSS files:

- "icss_url" : URL of a css file you would like to use only with indexes
- "mcss_url" : URL of a css file you would like to use only with messages
- "default_css_url" : URL of a default CSS file that will be used if
             either gicss_url or mcss_url are not declared. 

If "default_css_url" is not defined and is needed, hypermail will use
the name hypermail.css and will generate this file by itself with some
pre-defined rules, unless this file already exists in the archive
directory.

- Navigation bar for messages

Previoulsy hypermail used the same navigation bar for both indexes and
messages.  The new configuration option "mhtmlnavbar2upfile" let's you
include in hypermail generated messages more specific HTML formatting
statement giving links to the hierarchy of your archive. By default,
this option uses the value of "ihtmlnavbar2upfile".

- Other configuration option changes

Two new configuration options, "archive_date" and "hypermail_colophon",
allow you choose whether you want to display a line that says when the
archive was generated (only in the indexes) as well as a a line that
states that the archive was generated with hypermail and the
generation date (both in messages and indexes). Both these options may
be considered mutually exclusive as they both display the archive
generation date. You can disable both of them.

** DEPRECATED FEATURES

The configuration variable "indextable", which let hypermail
generate message indexes using tables has been deprecated in favor of
using HTML and CSS. This option has been disabled.  The pertaining
code will be removed from the code base in a future release.
